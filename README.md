## Questions & Answers

### 1. Difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector/querySelectorAll?
- getElementById selects one element by ID.
- getElementsByClassName selects multiple elements by class.
- querySelector selects the first matching element.
- querySelectorAll selects all matching elements.

### 2. How to create and insert a new element into the DOM?
We use document.createElement() and appendChild() or append() to insert it into the DOM.

### 3. What is Event Bubbling?
Event bubbling is when an event starts from the target element and propagates up to parent elements.

### 4. What is Event Delegation and why is it useful?
Event delegation is attaching one event listener to a parent element to handle child elements. It improves performance and works with dynamic elements.

### 5. Difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation()?
- preventDefault() stops default browser behavior.
- stopPropagation() stops event from bubbling to parent elements.
